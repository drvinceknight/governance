# Open Journals Governance

## The Project

Open Journals (The Project) is a collection of open source software projects affiliated with the 501c3 [NumFOCUS Foundation](https://www.numfocus.org). The goal of The Project is to develop open source software and deploy open access academic publishing services.

The software developed by The Project is released under the MIT (or similar) open source license, developed openly and hosted in public GitHub repositories under the [Open Journals GitHub organization](https://github.com/openjournals). Examples of Project Software include the [JOSS web application](https://github.com/openjournals/joss), the [Whedon RubyGem](https://github.com/openjournals/whedon), the [Whedon bot](https://github.com/openjournals/whedon-api) and more.

The services run by The Project consist of public websites and web-services that are hosted under the `theoj.org` and `briefideas.org` domain and include the Journal of Open Source Software (http://joss.theoj.org), the Journal of Open Source Education (http://jose.theoj.org), the Journal of Brief Ideas (http://beta.briefideas.org), and the Open Journal of Astrophysics (http://astro.theoj.org).

The Project is formally affiliated with the 501c3 NumFOCUS Foundation (http://numfocus.org), which serves as its fiscal sponsor, may hold project trademarks and other intellectual property, helps manage project donations and acts as a parent legal entity. In addition, one of our journals, the Journal of Open Source Software, is formally affiliated with the Open Source Initiative (https://opensource.org/affiliates/list). NumFOCUS is the only legal entity that has a formal relationship with The Project.

## Governance

This section describes the governance and leadership model of The Project.

The foundations of Project governance are:

- Openness & Transparency
- Active Contribution
- Institutional Neutrality

The Project leadership consists of a BDFL (Arfon Smith) and Steering Council.

### BDFL

The Project will have a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life), who is currently Arfon Smith. As Dictator, the BDFL has the authority to make all final decisions for The Project. As Benevolent, the BDFL, in practice chooses to defer that authority to the consensus of the community discussion channels and the Steering Council (see below). It is expected, and in the past has been the case, that the BDFL will only rarely assert his/her final authority. Because rarely used, we refer to BDFL’s final authority as a “special” or “overriding” vote. When it does occur, the BDFL override typically happens in situations where there is a deadlock in the Steering Council or if the Steering Council asks the BDFL to make a decision on a specific matter. To ensure the benevolence of the BDFL, The Project encourages others to fork the project if they disagree with the overall direction the BDFL is taking. The BDFL is chair of the Steering Council (see below) and may delegate his/her authority on a particular decision or set of decisions to any other Council member at his/her discretion.

The BDFL can appointing his/her successor, but it is expected that the Steering Council would be consulted on this decision. If the BDFL is unable to appoint a successor, the Steering Council will make a suggestion or suggestions to the Main NumFOCUS Board. While the Steering Council and Main NumFOCUS Board will work together closely on the BDFL selection process, the Main NumFOCUS Board will make the final decision.

### Steering Council

The Project will have a Steering Council that is elected to further the overall mission of the The Project. Initially the Council was created by the BDFL, however, future membership rules will determined by the Council itself. The overall role of the Council is to ensure, through working with the BDFL and taking input from the Community, the long-term well-being of the project, both technically, editorially, and as a community.

The Steering Council and its Members play a special role in certain situations. In particular, the Council may:

- Make decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of The Project.
- Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or individuals.
- Make decisions about new starting a new journal (or incorporating an existing journal) under the Open Journals organization.
- Make decisions about the Services that are run by The Project and manage those Services for the benefit of the Project and Community.
- Make decisions when regular community discussion doesn’t produce consensus on an issue in a reasonable time frame.

#### Steering Council membership

To be written by the Council.

#### Subcommittees

Question: Does each journal need its own subcommittee or is this effectively the editorial board of that journal?

#### NumFOCUS Subcommittee

The Council will maintain one narrowly focused subcommittee to manage its interactions with NumFOCUS.

- The NumFOCUS Subcommittee is comprised of 5 persons who manage project funding that comes through NumFOCUS. It is expected that these funds will be spent in a manner that is consistent with the non-profit mission of NumFOCUS and the direction of the Project as determined by the full Council.
- This Subcommittee shall NOT make decisions about the direction, scope or technical direction of the Project.
- This Subcommittee will have 5 members, 4 of whom will be current Steering Council members and 1 of whom will be external to the Steering Council.
